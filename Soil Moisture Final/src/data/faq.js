	  question: "What is the Smart Irrigation System?",
	  answer: `The Smart Irrigation System is an automated solution that optimizes water usage by analyzing real-time soil moisture, crop requirements, and weather conditions. It helps farmers and gardeners ensure efficient water delivery with minimal waste.`,
	},
	{
	  question: "How does the system work?",
	  answer: `Our system uses sensors to monitor soil moisture and weather forecasts. Based on crop data and predefined thresholds, it decides whether to activate or deactivate the water pump. Users can monitor and control the pump remotely through a cloud-based web app.`,
	},
	{
	  question: "What crops can the system support?",
	  answer: `The system supports a wide range of crops by utilizing datasets with specific water requirements for each crop. Simply select the crop you are growing, and the system will adjust watering schedules accordingly.`,
	},
	{
	  question: "Can I control the irrigation remotely?",
	  answer: `Yes! You can monitor sensor data and manage the pump status remotely through our web app. Youâ€™ll receive real-time updates on soil conditions and pump activity to stay informed about your farm.`,
	},
	{
	  question: "What happens if it rains unexpectedly?",
	  answer: `The system integrates with weather APIs to predict rainfall. If rain is forecasted, it will delay or skip irrigation to conserve water. You can also configure manual overrides if needed.`,
	},
	{
	  question: "How often is the soil moisture data updated?",
	  answer: `The system collects data from soil moisture sensors in real-time or at scheduled intervals. The frequency can be customized based on crop type and farm conditions to ensure precise watering.`,
	},
	{
	  question: "What if the internet connection is lost?",
	  answer: `In case of connectivity issues, the system can run in offline mode using pre-configured thresholds and schedules. As soon as the connection is restored, it will sync with the cloud and update the data.`,
